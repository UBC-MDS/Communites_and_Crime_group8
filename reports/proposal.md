## Research questions

The crime rate in a community is an important factor that citizens consider when making decisions about whether to live or invest. A high crime rate in a city may impact personal safety, property values, and overall quality of life. The crime rate can be influenced by many factors, and our dataset potentially captures some of them to answer the following research questions:

- Which state was the most crime-ridden in the USA in 1995?

- What factors are most statistically associated with the crime rate of an area?

- Is the number of police officers per population statistically correlated with the crime rate of a community? If so, is it a positive or negative correlation?

## Usage scenario

Laura is a criminology student who has been hired by the government to perform an analysis on the contributing factors of crime rates in a city. She has been given a dataset with over 100 columns and wants to explore it in order to find meaningful associations between crime rates and other possible features in the dataset. With a background in criminology, Laura has prior knowledge of which factors might be correlated with crime rates; however, she wants to visually present the relationships between available columns in the dataset if her boss is interested. Furthermore, she wants to visualize the crime rate using an interactive map representation, which would be intuitive for others to understand the overall idea of the crime that has happened in the US.

Laura then installs the "Communities and Crime" app. She sees a map of the US with the implemented crime rate. This first page gives her the distribution of crime in the US according to her dataset. The map can be further zoomed in, given a city query, and a local display of crime rates will be presented. On the second page, she is able to view the demographic decomposition of a community, as well as a graphical representation of the relationship between crime rates and other features. The features can be selected on the left panel in the search bar to discover the desired feature that might be statistically associated with crime rates. She hypothesize that the amount of the police force is has is statistically significant and would like to utilize the app for her next report meeting.
