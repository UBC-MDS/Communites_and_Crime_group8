# Crime Rate Finder App
Link to the dashboard: [Crime Rate Finder](https://missarah.shinyapps.io/Communites_and_Crime_group8/)


## Motivation

The crime rate in a community is an important factor that citizens consider when making decisions about whether to live or invest. A high crime rate in a city may impact personal safety, property values, and overall quality of life and is influenced by many factors. Understanding where, how and why crime happens is important for fighting and lowering crime rates, hence increasing safety in communities. Since 1930, the FBI has been collecting data on the types, amounts, and impact of crime in the United States through the Uniform Crime Reporting Program. So, our dashboard will aim to figure out the socioeconomic conditions, sociodemographic and community factors influencing crime rate in different US states as well as provide access to crime data in an understandable and intuitive manner.


## Description of the Dashboard

This interactive visualization and exploration tool will contain an interactive map as a landing page that will show the violent crimes committed in the Continental United States of America by State and County.

The top menu is used for overall navigation and will include a 'Main Dashboard', 'Data Sources' and 'Download Data' options:

-   'Data Sources' will navigate the user to a document detailing the sources for the data presented and explanations of the datapoints used

-   'Download Data' aims to give the user the capability of downloading a table with the data as sliced using the filters available On the left there will be a filter menu to slice the data and show specific insights. On the second tab (which will maintain the filters made on the left-hand panel) it will include a bar chart denoting the communities' composition and another bar chart denoting police composition. Below it will include a line chart showing the crime statistics in a time series (for 1995).

In the left-hand filter menu the user will have the liberty of choosing: State, county, time interval (within 1995), community type (based on income and racial composition), police presence (amount of police officers) and police budget allocated. It will also include cards stating "Percentage of Violent Crimes", 'Overall Country Crime Percentage' and 'Police Presence'

## Usability of the New App
The Crime Rate Finder App contain an interactive map as a landing page that will show the violent crimes committed in the Continental United States of America by State and County.

The top menu is used for overall navigation and will include a ‘Data Exploration’, ‘Correlation’ and ‘Scatter’ options:

- ‘Data Exploration’ enables users to select “State” and “Community” to look at the crime rate at each community on a map, and users can also directly swipe and zoom map to to refer the respective crime rate. When the user arrives at a datapoint and clicks on the marker a callout will indicate the Crime Rate in the Community.

- ‘Correlation’ aims to explore the correlation between community composition and violent crimes in a given state (or the entire continental USA).

- ‘Scatter’ aims to plot the relationship between crime rate and different variables that represent a community’s composition. By selecting the option of “Communities in the State” the user can see a table which represents the data in the scatterplot for easy readability.
