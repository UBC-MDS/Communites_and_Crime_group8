## Reflection

- <b> Q - What have we implemented in our dashboard? </b>
Our dashboard allows the user to view the crime rate in each state in a Leaflet map. We also created clusters where counties in a state were too closer to each other or were overlapping. Our dashboard also allows us to view the scatter plot with a linear regression line between violent crime rate and select factors (that have enough data and less missing values) in the dataset per state. The user can choose the state and the desired factor to be plotted against violent crime using two dropdown menus. Lastly, our dashboard allows the user to view the correlation between the desired factors and violent crime rate per state to help determine if more factors are associated with a high crime rate in some states more than the others.

- <b> Q - What has not been implemented in our dashboard? </b>





- <b> Q - What are the limitations of our dashboard? </b>





- <b> Q - What are good future improvements and additions to our dashboard? </b>
A possible addition is to add some of the other variables in our map. For example, coloring the state by population so a higher population would have a darker red background for the state whereas a lower population would have a light red color, etc... Another addition is to add an extra plot that is not related to correlation, such as a bar chart of one 2-4 variables per state.
