## Reflection

- <b> Q - Has it been easy to use your app? </b>

Based on the reflection of our peers, they think our app is easy to use and the layout of the dashboard is clear and well-organized. We are very happy to know this, and this is exactly what we want our app to look like. Since we assume our primary targeted users have a non-technical background, it is very important that the app is ready to use, and with minimal technical requirements. 

- <b> Q - Are there reoccurring themes in your feedback on what is good and what can be improved? </b>

One peer suggests adding one additional tab -- "More Information" so that we can include other useful information that is not presented. We think it is a good idea to include some useful links as our primary targeted users want to learn about the distribution of crime rates in communities in the United States. For example, we will add two links from the FBI. One link (https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s) will direct users to the complete FBI yearly crime report from 1995-2019. These reports reveal many details of crimes that might be helpful for their research. In another link (https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend), users can easily explore the crime data for different purposes. Finally, we also include a Wikipedia page about crime in the United States, which describes the topics at a high level.

- <b> Q - Is there any feedback (or other insight) that you have found particularly valuable during your dashboard development? </b>

In our proposal, we describe a usage scenario where a criminology student hypothesizes that the amount of the police force is has is statistically significant and would like to utilize the app for her next report meeting. One peer pointed out we did not mention this "statistically significant" in our final dashboard. While we think it is a good idea, we also realize that what we we mean by "statistically significant" here is that users can take advantage of the results return by this app and then combine it with other evidence to draw a conclusion. We cannot state a statistically significant conclusion solely based on this app. However, we believe that this could be the direction of the app in the future and programmers can take over from here to keep improving the app.
